I finally made up on my promise to set this up, and hopefully post some rants!

In case anyone's wondering, this is a simple recipe. Just get one [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/), add some
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and top it up with a theme (for which I have [Agus
Makmun](https://github.com/agusmakmun/agusmakmun.github.io) to thank for).

You get free hosting, a fast, static site, and the serenity of working with Markdown and version control ❤️
